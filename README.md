Hey there, Sol here. I likely won't be updating this again due to being completely swamped with university, and a general disinterest in Minecraft.
Apologies to all of the people who sent me PMs requesting updates. 
I've made the Git repository public, so anyone who wants to work on it should be able to. Luckily, the plugin is pretty simple,
so it shouldn't take more than a little bit of messing with to update. ðŸ’•
